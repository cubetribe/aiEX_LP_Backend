# LeadId URL Parameter Fix - Test Plan

## Issue Description
The frontend was not properly handling the `leadId` URL parameter. When visiting:
`https://aiex-quiz-platform-9cuvcwowe-cubetribes-projects.vercel.app/campaign/test3?leadId=18`

Instead of jumping to the result display for Lead 18, it just showed the campaign start page and ran through the entire quiz flow again.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Added URL Parameter Parsing**: Import and use `useSearchParams` from Next.js
2. **Created loadExistingLead Function**: Fetches lead status and result data  
3. **Added Lead State Detection**: Handles completed, processing, pending, failed states
4. **Direct Result Display**: Skips quiz and jumps to result display immediately
5. **Debug Support**: Added leadId parameter to debug info display

## Code Changes
### Frontend-Deploy/app/campaign/[slug]/page.tsx
- Added `useSearchParams` import
- Added `leadIdParam` extraction from URL
- Added `loadExistingLead()` function
- Added useEffect to trigger loadExistingLead when leadId present
- Updated debug info to show leadId parameter

### Key Functions Added
```typescript
const searchParams = useSearchParams();
const leadIdParam = searchParams.get('leadId');

const loadExistingLead = async (leadId: string) => {
  // 1. Fetch lead status from /leads/{id}/status
  // 2. If completed, fetch result from /leads/{id}/result  
  // 3. Jump to appropriate step (result/processing)
  // 4. Handle errors gracefully
}
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. **Normal Flow**: `/campaign/test3` → Shows quiz start page
2. **Direct Access**: `/campaign/test3?leadId=18` → Loads Lead 18 result directly
3. **Processing State**: `/campaign/test3?leadId=X` → Shows processing if lead still processing
4. **Error Handling**: Invalid leadId shows error message

## Test Cases to Verify

### Test Case 1: Completed Lead
- URL: `/campaign/test3?leadId=18`
- Expected: Direct jump to result display with Lead 18 data
- Backend confirms: Lead 18 status = "completed", score = 66

### Test Case 2: Invalid Lead ID  
- URL: `/campaign/test3?leadId=999`
- Expected: Error message about lead not found

### Test Case 3: Normal Flow Still Works
- URL: `/campaign/test3`
- Expected: Normal quiz start page (no leadId interference)

### Test Case 4: Processing Lead
- URL: `/campaign/test3?leadId=X` (where X is processing)
- Expected: Jump to processing display with real-time updates

## Backend API Endpoints Verified Working
✅ GET `/leads/18/status` → Returns completed status with progress 100%
✅ GET `/leads/18/result` → Returns formatted AI result with display permissions

## Deployment Status  
✅ Frontend-Deploy updated and deployed to Vercel
✅ Git commits created with detailed change descriptions
✅ Both Frontend and Frontend-Deploy versions updated

## Debug Features
When `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_DEBUGGING=true`:
- Console logs for lead loading process
- Debug info panel shows leadId parameter value
- API call logging for status/result fetching

## Next Steps for Manual Testing
1. Visit: `https://aiex-quiz-platform-9cuvcwowe-cubetribes-projects.vercel.app/campaign/test3?leadId=18`
2. Verify it loads Lead 18 results directly (bypasses quiz)
3. Check debug console for proper API calls
4. Test normal flow still works without leadId parameter
